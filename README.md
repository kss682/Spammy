This is an intelligent Web app which analyses the various messages or conversation you enter and classifies

conversation which you have entered is a spam or Ham(Not spam). It may seem simple at the beginning , but 

the project uses topics like Machine Learning ,Spam filter algorithms , Natural Language Processing  and Web Technologies .
