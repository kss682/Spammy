"Hi Navdeep, ""While working with the Arduino-Scilab toolbox, same issue come up everytime.Serial port does not close properly and I am unable to upload any program.""--- I think Arduino-Scilab toolbox is developed so that you need not 'Upload any program' in Arduino.Also as manas correctly said, serial port is not closed from scilab side(i.e. your computer machine/laptop). When we have any error in .sce file while working with scilab-arduino toolbox, code terminates in between so the close_serial (1) does not get executed. It happens quite a lot especially when you are learning new experiments. If one wants full-proof solution, we need to perform close_serial(1) every time scilab code terminates (because of whatever reason). So we need to catch the event of termination and run our function which has close_serial(1) written. I will post if it works. For the temporary solution we can perform following troubleshooting 1. use command abort and close_serial(1)2. remove and re-plug USB cable in laptop3. reset Arduino",Not Spam

"Tips to use Equilibrium\r\nreactor \r\n\r\n1. In the flow sheet panel, drag and use the\r\n""Equilibrium reactor"" from the object palette\r\n\r\n2. ""Equilibrium reactor"" requires one inlet\r\nmaterial stream, two outlet material stream (one for liquid and one for vapour)\r\nand one energy stream to be connected to it\r\n\r\n3. Use ""Reaction manager"" under\r\n""Tools"" to create ""Chemical reactions"" and ""Reaction\r\nset"". For example, water gas shift reaction is illustrated. Give stoichiometric coefficients and also choose base component. Enable calculation of equilibrium constant from Gibbs energy of the reaction. 4. The equilibrium reactor can be simulated at three different modes - Isothermal (temperature fixed at inlet stream value), adiabatic or with a temperature (as that of outlet stream). In the present example, isothermal mode if choosen.5. Once all specifications are iven, activate and run (""recalculate"") the simulation The DWSIM simulation illustrating equilibrium reactor with WGS reaction can be found at the following link http://bit.ly/DWSIM-Equilibrium-Reactor-WGS I hope with this tips, you are able to successfully build and develop equilibrium reactorThanksNaren ",Not Spam

"Dear Winderson,We have created our own component in Kicad for simulation in ngspice. The reason is there are few components in Kicad whose netlist generation are not in order with that of ngspice. In our earlier version(OSCAD), We were doing mapping in Kicad to Ngspice converter for all such component whose netlist are not in order with ngspice but that was not great solution because if Kicad people change the netlist format then again we have to redo the mapping in our source code I would suggest you to use Kicad's own component for PCB designing and for simulation you can use eSim's component.Hope this answer your query. ",Not Spam

So why not use Ubuntu- All the functionalities that are available in windows are easily available in Ubuntu- OpenFOAM is best learnt while working in Ubuntu ( personal experience)- Learning Linux helps you lot  in  academia as well as getting job industry. ",Not Spam

"You can go to new compound creator study, then create your own database using the Create New option. A new xml file will be created. After than you can create the new compound by entering the required properties. Then click on the option Save compound to the database and then save the simulation. Now go to settings-->general settings-->Datasets and click on Add User database. Search the xml file for the new database you have created and add it. The next time you start DWSIM you will find the compound. Alternately you can add the compound to an existing database like Chemsep or DWSIM. The procedure is same except that in the new compound creator study instead of creating a new database click on Search and select the xml file for the database (chemsep.xml or DWSIM.xml) which will be there in DWSIM's installed folder.",Not Spam
"Dear Subhankar,Kindly elaborate more on how the results you are getting are different. What do you exactly mean by run time and execution time? What changes did you make in the controlDict and blockMeshDict file?Which version of OpenFOAM and ParaView are you using? As a beginner, I think you should start learning from the in-build case files given in OpenFOAM within tutorial folder. You can simply run the icoFoam solver for this case without making any changes in the case file. The spoken tutorials prepared in context to the lid driven cavity explains the example well and how the case file works. Please go through the tutorials from the beginning and follow it step by step to get a basic ideas about how a simulations is created in OpenFOAM. You may also go through this  link: Lid driven cavity for more insight into this problem. Since, In OpenFOAM, every problem is case specific it is very difficult to build a tutorial on writing the files. But you can always go through the documentation: OpenFOAM user guide to get some initial perception. RegardsSubhasree BasuCFD Team, Fossee,IIT Bombay",Not Spam

"The logic for creating new compounds is a little complicated, I know. The purpose is to allow the user to have multiple databases of its own (the ""XML"" files), and the ""dwcsd"" files which will contain the data for each single compound created. This way the user can use the compound creator to edit the data for a previous added compound by opening the ""dwcsd"" file and then re-adding the compound to the database once he/she finished the editing process.Daniel",Not Spam
"Hi,In DWSIM, each reactor type has its corresponding reaction type. Equilibrium reactors work with equilibrium reactions. Equilibrium reactors solve the chemical equilibrium by using the reaction extent approach. Gibbs reactors can work with equilibrium reactions or without any reaction information (gibbs minimization mode). In this case, it will respect the element mass balance and try to find a state where the gibbs free energy will be at a minimum. This approach works only for single, vapor phase systems.Daniel",Not Spam

"In ""wikipedia"" the infinite is defined as something without any bound or larger than any number.But in the computation, the program needs a value to do the calculations. One can not touch or reach infinity but for his own satisfaction he goes to a maximum extent. By using this, one can select a maximum value to solve the given problem. I am considering the 10^25 as the maximum extent for exp(at) where a> 0. With the maximum value we can find the ""t"" in the following way exp(at) = 10^25, t = 25*log(10)/a. By using this ""t"" value we can solve the plotting problem. I am writing a simple code about it and hoping that it will be the right answer.function Exp(a)\n    t = 25*log(10)/a\n    t = ceil(t)\n    time = 0:t/1000:t\n    s = poly(0,'s')\n    temptf = syslin('c',1/(s+a))\n    y = csim('step',time,temptf)\n    plot(y,time)\nendfunction",Not Spam

Since the icoFoam is based on PISO algorithm, it will keep on running based on the endTime specified at controlDict file.
say for example, if you have a problem which becomes steady state after some iterations, the residuals will fall down say 10^-5, but still the solver continues to run.
You can stop the iterations manually once it reaches the desired convergence value.

"Hi Subhankar, you can use openfoam utility to get the wall shear stress by typing 
 ""solvername"" -postProcess -func wallShearStress -latestTime command in the terminal.

E.g. simpleFoam -postProcess -func wallShearStress -latestTime or newTimes

which will create the wallShearStress field in paraFoam, which can be used to calculate Cf.

There is createBaffleDict utility in OpenFoam to create Baffles in a geometry.

"I am happy that you chose to post this ""Scilab"" question in the ""Python"" forum.  The reason is that Python is more suitable to computer programmers like you.  

Scilab is likely to have a lot more ""application"" type of libraries, compared to Python.  Scilab is more like Matlab than Python is.  But both of these advantages are not relevant to you.  On the other hand, it is possible to do all kinds of programming in Python: starting from device level communication to fancy application programming.  

Finally, there are a lot of employment opportunities for those who know Python.  Because of all these,  please consider Python programming.  All the projects that I mentioned about Scilab are available for Python also.  For example, contribute a Python textbook companion.  If you are already good in Python, get into advanced activities like Django programming.  If you are good in Python programming, we will be interested in giving an internship or a full time job to you.

The ""function not defined"" error occurs when you try to call a function without loading it. The ""getd"" command in the start.sce file is probably failing.

Up to my understanding, in Pharmacy ,there must be a problem statement. That statement will have a well define model which may be intuitive or mathematical . Now, the creativity part comes here. You can write those models as Scilab functions and can create a new tool box for whole Pharmacy community.

I am

 try to run the simulation it gives me: ""Error while opening pyhon

"The equilibrium reactor is a simplified reactor model for which \r\nonly equilibrium reactions can be specified.

The reactions are in equilibrium in the phases in which the reactions\r\ntake place (in the selected reaction package a phase is specified with a reaction). If the reaction\r\nphase is not present, the reaction will not take place.\r\nIf you know in advance that the resulting reactor product will only be single phase, it is advised to use a CSTR or Gibbz minimization reactor instead.

"Hi,The diode component from eSim_Devices Eeschema library have changed pin numbers in comparison to kicad Device lib.The diode draw cathode is named as K and his pin number is 2, while diode anode is named as A and have pin number 1. In the KiCad Device Lib K is numbered as 1 and A as 2. Also the draw is Y mirrored.This may not seems to be a problem because you would use eSim devices to simulate a circuit only. But KiCad has a problem with duplicated names in different libs. In my case, I had used an already prepared hierarchical sheet in a new board which the components should be updated. KiCad assimilate my diodes to eSim_Devices  D and all the footprints in my board (which use KiCad lib diode numeration) went reversed.I think that ngspice use pin 1 as anode and pin 2 as cathode, so simply invert the component pins would not be possible, and also the diodes should be named as D.What can we do? Maybe it can be solve in kicad to ngspice converter?",Not Spam

"Hi
I came across a question asked in cfd-online discussion forum and my problem is same as that. The problem is when i am trying to use the plot over the line option in paraview either one of two things 
happens: 



1) ""Plot over line"" option is not even available on the list 



or



2) ""Plot over line"" is greyed out and not a possible option. 



I can't find any explanation for this as it seems that this filter 
option is the  most basic and all tutorials say to use it (although do 
not give advice if the option is not available). 
I am hoping to get some help here because i couldn't find any helpful advice in that forum.

I have a short question: I want to convert a grayscale-image (matrix of floats from 0 to 1) into a binary image having only 0 and 1, depending on a set threshold. Therefore I wrote this two alternative routines:Routine Afor i=1:length(image)
        if image(i) < threshold then
            image(i) = 0;
        else
            image(i) = 1;

"Hey guys,
I am currently working with the IPCV toolbox command imlabel for identifying particles in an image.Everything works quite well, but the problem is that the output from the imlabel is in int8-format, which allows only 256 different labels. However, in my image there are way a few thousands. Consequently, each identified label containes multiple particles, because in the int8 format the numbers are being overwritten, when labels larger than 255 are being added...
Soooo... Is there a way to make the command output an int16 for instance?
At the moment I could only think of a workaround by taking each label from the int8 and run the imlabel-command again. However, that means that I have to perform the imlabel-command 257 times (1 original and than 256 for each int-label in the 8bit range). And THAT takes some time, just to extract information that was already obtained but lost through the int8-formatting :(",Not Spam
"Good day Sir/Mam
I am a chemical engineering student from South Africa. I watched the shortcut and rigorous distillation tutorial which were extremely helpful for my project. 
However I wanted to ask how do you assign operating pressure for distillation column ? I have to design a pressure swing distillation system, where the first column operates at a low pressure and the second column operates at a higher pressure to separate azeotropic mixture. How can I change the operating pressures of both columns?
Your assistance would be much appreciated.

"Hello,
First I would like to describe what i am doing.
Description: There is a pipe closed at bottom and open at top(similar to test tube) with dimensions 0.126 m diameter and 0.5 m height. Inside the pipe there is concrete filled upto 0.124m dia and rest at the internal walls filled with lubricating layer(paste). Now side walls are moved down with a velocity of 0.6679m/s downwards. No dynamic mesh used. It is a static case.

Now my problem is, I believe i have implemented everything fine in openFOAM and simulation ran succesfully. After some some i found the amount of lubricant which was initialised at walls is increasing in quantity and occupying entire cylinder. Concrete is not found. Don't know why ?

"Hello,
I have a matrix problem with quite a simple code. The point of this code is to create a new vector, similar to a previous one, but with a different dimension.
The dimension of the new vectors created is set by a variable value, which I call ""dim"" in my code. I want to create a new vector ""xnew"" which has same values as the vector ""x"" which I created previously in my code.
So I create first a zero matrix :
xnew=zeros(dim,1);
Then I copy the values of x (big vector) to xnew (same but smaller) with a loop :
for i=1:dim    xnew(i,1)=x(i,1);end
Problem : if I display my new vector (xnew), the last line is missing. If I check the size of the matrix ""xnew"", it gives me a line dimension which is one unit less than the variable ""dim"". But if I display this variable ""dim"" at any part of the code, I always have dim which has the good value, but the matrix systematically miss one unit and has a dimension of (dim-1, 1).
This is for me very strange, and if I use constant values I don't have this problem. Does somebody have a clue of the potential reason of this?",Not Spam
